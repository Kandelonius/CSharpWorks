# Pillars of object oriented programming

## The pillars are:

### - Inheritance
##### 1. A structure where classes are able to use properties methods and fields from a parent class. Any unique items the child class has are not shared by the parent class.
##### 2. There are 4 types of inheritance:
#####   a. Single Inheritance where the inherited item is taken from the level directly above the current level
#####   b. Hierarchical Inheritance where there is more than one class directly derived from one base class
#####   c. Multi-level Inheritance where the inherited item can be take from a level 2 or more levels above
#####   d. Multiple Inheritance where the inherited item is taken from multiple distinct sources that aren't directly connected
######    *Note: Multiple Inheritance is not directly supported in C#, but can be approximated using interfaces

### - Encapsulation

### - Abstraction

### - Polymorphism

### Using vehicles as an example I hope to touch on all of these pillars and identify the concepts as I use them
