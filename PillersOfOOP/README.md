# Pillars of object oriented programming

## The pillars are:

### - Inheritance
##### A structure where classes are able to inherit properties from a parent class. This includes methods and fields. Any unique properties the child class has are not shared by the parent class.

### - Encapsulation

### - Abstraction

### - Polymorphism

### Using vehicles as an example I hope to touch on all of these pillars and identify the concepts as I use them
