Azure and cloud computing

Questions to keep in mind -

- Explain Subnets?
	A- A virtual network can be partitioned into one or more sub-networks. The subnets can be separated
	logically and each subnet consists of a server
		- A subnet can be further divided into two types: Public and Private
- What are some benefits of cloud?
	A- High scalability, disaster recovery, high security, highly reliable, worldwide connectivity
- What are the different deployment models?
	A- 
		Public - allows for public access such as azure and AWS
		Private - allows for very limited access to the cloud service
		Hybrid - used by government agencies that need to store sensitive information but also need a 
			public facing presence
- What are the service models, when should you use them?
	A-
		IAAS(Infrastructure as a service) - Used when your company needs a VM, servers or storage
		PAAS(Platform as a service) - Used when your company needs a platform for building software
		SAAS(Software as a service) - Used when your company doesn't want to maintain any IT equipment
- What are different types of Data? explain?
	A-
		Structured data - Data that is defined and understoon such as SQL data
		Semi-structured data - Not as defined but does have some structure, NOSQL
		Unstructured data - Data that isn't well defined such as image or video files
- Explain Storage LifeCycle of a Data?
	A- 
		Real time - On demand, accessed often. Used for caching, searching, high performance workloads
		Near time - used for standard workloads, computations, video
		Long term - used for time based, use based, expiry based actions
		Archive - not meant to be accessed except on rare occasions. Used for backups and compliance
- What is maximum data you can store per Storage Account?
	A- 500 TB per account and each subscription can have up to 100 storage accounts by default
- Types of Storage Accounts? Explain?
	A- 
		Blob Storage - Hardware-level, generally accessed by an operating system
		Queue Storage - flat storage for unstructured data, supports massive scale, often includes metadata(tags)
		Table Storage - Simple storage system for non-relational semi-structured data
		File Storage - Managed, traditional file sharing like solution
- Explain Storage Account Properties?
	A-
		Account type - Blob, Queue, Table, File - See above
		Performance Tier -
			- Standard: Default tier with typical speeds for most production workloads
			- Premium: High performance. 
				GPv1/GPv2 for unmanaged disks and page blob
				Blob storage doesn't support
				Block blob: block and append blobs do support it
				File storage supports for files only
		Replication - LRS, GRS, ZRS, GZRS - See below
		Access Tier - Hot(immediate access), Cool(occasional access), Archive(rare access long-term)
- Explain the types of Replication?
	A-
		LRS(Locally-redundant storage) replication to 3 other units within the region
		GRS(Geo-redundant storage) replication to a secondary region, includes LRS-like replication
		ZRS(Zone-redundant storage) replication to 3 availability zones within the region
		GZRS(Geo-zone-redundant storage) a combination of ZRS and GRS
- Types of Blob Storage?
	A- 
		Block Blob - Used for straming workloads, each blob consists of a sequence of blocks, 200 GB per blob
		Page Blob - Used for random read/write workloads, blobs consist of an array of pages, 1TB per blob
- What is Disaster Recovery? Explain?
	A- a system's ability to backup and restore data, apps and resources as needed. Azure supports
	this by allowing users to regularly backup resources, connect on-prem to on-prem, connect on-prem to cloud etc.
- What is Scalability? Explain it types?
	A- Scalability is a system's ability to adapt to an increase or decrease in demand
		Scale out/in - This refers to creating more resources by adding more infrastructure ie. more VMs storage etc.
		Scale up/down - This refers to adding more resources to your in place infrastructure ie larger storage units
- What is Hierarchy for creating a resource in Azure?
- What are the default entities Table Storage has?
- What is the Hierarchy of Table storage?
- What is max size supported for Queue storage?
	A- A queue storage account can support up to 500 TB, but each message can only be 64 KB
- Does Queue Storage support first-in-first-out model? explain?
	A- No, a message in queue storage only leaves when its condition is met or it is dequeued either
	manually or an automated dequeue condition is met

		b) can be accessed by the general public
		c) all software, hardware and other infrastructure is owned by the cloud provider

	private cloud - AWS, VMware
		a) cloud infrastructure is used exclusively by a single organization
		b) may be run privately or outsourced to a hosting company
		c) services and infrastructure are mainained on a private network

	hybrid cloud - Federal agencies opt for private cloud for sensitive information and public cloud for general consumption
		a) contains elements of both public and private cloud

Service models -
	IAAS (Infrastructure as a service) - used by IT administrators
		a) provides basic computing infrastructure
		b) services are available on a Pay-for-use basis

	PAAS (Platform as a service) - used by developers

Azure physical infrastructure hierarchy -
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/availability-zones/media/az-overview/az-graphic-two.png
	Region - 
		a) can contain multiple any number of data centers and availability zones and are globally distributed
		b) currently about 60 regions globally
		c) not all services are available in all regions - could be relevant when choosing a region to deploy to
			* a good tool to test the fastest region for your location is https://azurespeedtest.azurewebsites.net/
			* a tool to test which products are available in a region is https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/global-infrastructure/services/

	Availability zone - a collection of data centers with the purpose of allowing for back-ups for data centers

Azure Data lake service – Gen 2 (ADLS) is currently preferred
	Designed for storage of big (unstructured) data
	Supports massive volumes
	Supports massive throughput
	Cost-effective
	Provides HDFS compatible storage to analytics tools, including HDInsight, Hadoop etc.
	Supports various management features including security, a hierarchical namespace and encryption

Data Lake – Management and Security:
	* differences between blob and ADLS- 
		1) ADLS supports a true file system
		2) ADLS supports hierarchical namespace

	Blob storage functionality is still available
		Access tie and lifecycle management
		Global scale
	Security (including features from Blob storage
Connectivity:

BlobFuse – open source project developed to provide a virtual file system backed by Azure Blob storage
Uses libfuse open source library to communicate with the Linux FUSE kernel model and implements the file system operations using the Azure Storage Blob REST APIs
-Features
	Mount a Blob storage on Linux
	Basic file system operations ie. Mkdir, opendir, readdir, rmdir, open, read, create, write, close, unlink, truncate, stat, rename
	Local cache to improve subsequent access times
