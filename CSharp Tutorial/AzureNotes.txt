Deployment models -
	public cloud - Azure, AWS IMB Cloud
		a) services are stored off-site
		b) can be accessed by the general public
		c) all software, hardware and other infrastructure is owned by the cloud provider

	private cloud - AWS, VMware
		a) cloud infrastructure is used exclusively by a single organization
		b) may be run privately or outsourced to a hosting company
		c) services and infrastructure are mainained on a private network

	hybrid cloud - Federal agencies opt for private cloud for sensitive information and public cloud for general consumption
		a) contains elements of both public and private cloud

Service models -
	IAAS (Infrastructure as a service) - used by IT administrators
		a) provides basic computing infrastructure
		b) services are available on a Pay-for-use basis

	PAAS (Platform as a service) - used by developers
		a) provides cloud platforms and runtime environments for developing, testing and managing applications
		b) allows developers to deploy applications without requiring all of the infrastructure

	SAAS (Software as a service) - used by general users
		a) cloud providers host and manage software on a Pay-for-use basis
		b) fully managed by the cloud provider so the end user doesn't have to maintain anything

Azure physical infrastructure hierarchy -
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/availability-zones/media/az-overview/az-graphic-two.png
	Region - 
		a) can contain multiple any number of data centers and availability zones and are globally distributed
		b) currently about 60 regions globally
		c) not all services are available in all regions - could be relevant when choosing a region to deploy to
			* a good tool to test the fastest region for your location is https://azurespeedtest.azurewebsites.net/
			* a tool to test which products are available in a region is https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/global-infrastructure/services/

	Availability zone - a collection of data centers with the purpose of allowing for back-ups for data centers

	Data center - used to host a group of network servers with their own power, cooling and network infrastructure
	
Fault tolerance -
	Proactive -
		a) regularly backup data, apps, resources
		b) deploy to multiple availability zones or regions
		c) Load balance across multiple availibility zones or regions
		d) monitor health of data, apps, resources
	Reactive -
		a) restore data, apps, resources to different availability zones
		b) deploy to different availability zones or regions

Desaster recovery - can use azure to restore
	a) regularly backup data, apps, resources
	b) on-prem to on-prem
	c) on-prem to cloud
	d) other cloud to Azure
	e) Azure to Azure

Scalability -
	Scaling Out - non-disruptive aka doesn't require a reset
		a) increase instance count of resources

	Scaling up - disruptive aka requires a reset
		a) Increase instance size of existing resources

Elasticity - the ability to adapt to changing demands by scaling up, down, out, in

Azure hierarchy for subscription is: Subscription - Azure Region - (Tenant, Resource group VM, Resource group Network)
hierarchy for Active Directory is: Subscription - Azure Region - Tenant
hierarchy for Virtual Machine is: Subscription - Azure Region - Resource group
heirarchy for Virtual Network is: Subscription - Azure Region - Resource group
hierarchy for Storage is: Subscription - Azure region - Resource group

Major Azure service groups -
	Compute - VM, VM Scale sets, Cloud services, contianers etc.
	Networking - Virtual network, Azure DNS, Application gateway, Traffic manager etc.
	Data and Storage - Disk storage, Blob storage, File storage, Queue storage, Table storage, StorSimple
	Web and Mobile - Web apps, Mobile apps, Logic apps, Contend delivery network
	Other Services - Azure AD, Site Recovery, Network watcher, Azure security center, etc.

Storage data types -
	Structured data
		1) well defined data such as data from a RDMS

	Semi-structured data
		1) not as defined as structured data - NOSQL data includes JSON formatted data and graphs

	Unstructured data
		1) not well organized, may have an internal structure but it is not know to us - image or video files

Storage lifecycle -
	Real time - caching, search, performance workloads, event processing
		Replication requirements - low
		Cost - high
		Speed of access - high
		Read / write mix - heavy R/W

	Near time - compute, video, standard workloads
		Replication requirements - low
			Cost - high
			Speed of access - medium
			Read / write mix - balanced R/W

	Long term - time-based, use-based, expiry based, size based
		Replication requirements - medium
		Cost - medium
		Speed of access - low
		Read / write mix - mostly read

	Archive - backup, compliance
		Replication requirements - high
		Cost - low
		Speed of access - low
		Read / write mix - read on demand

Azure Data lake service – Gen 2 (ADLS) is currently preferred
	Designed for storage of big (unstructured) data
	Supports massive volumes
	Supports massive throughput
	Cost-effective
	Provides HDFS compatible storage to analytics tools, including HDInsight, Hadoop etc.
	Supports various management features including security, a hierarchical namespace and encryption

Data Lake – Management and Security:
	* differences between blob and ADLS- 
		1) ADLS supports a true file system
		2) ADLS supports hierarchical namespace

	Blob storage functionality is still available
		Access tie and lifecycle management
		Global scale
	Security (including features from Blob storage
Connectivity:
•	…
BlobFuse – open source project developed to provide a virtual file system backed by Azure Blob storage
Uses libfuse open source library to communicate with the Linux FUSE kernel model and implements the file system operations using the Azure Storage Blob REST APIs
-Features
	Mount a Blob storage on Linux
	Basic file system operations ie. Mkdir, opendir, readdir, rmdir, open, read, create, write, close, unlink, truncate, stat, rename
	Local cache to improve subsequent access times
Network File System(NFS) 3.0 –
