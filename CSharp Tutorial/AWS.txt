Q. What are the consideration when creating an S3 bucket?
A. The most important things to consider the name and the region. The region must be the same as the 
	services that will be attached to the S3 bucket.
Q. What type of storage is S3?
A. S3 stores objects
Q. How to protect data at rest in S3 bucket?
A. To protect data at rest there is server side encryption and client side encryption. Server side 
	encrypts the data at the AWS center and client side encrypts at the user location.
Q. Explain S3 versioning
A. S3 versioning allows you to refer or revert back to previous versions of the bucket or the contents 
	of the bucket. You can retrieve deleted or corrupted items as long as they were part of a previous version.
Q. What is S3 multipart upload?
A. Multipart upload is useful for large objects(100 MB+) it allows you to upload objects in parts and in any order. 
	Any failed segments will be reattempted until successful. This option is best for large objects and use on 
	unreliable networks.
Q. Explain Lifecycle Policy in S3?
A. Lifecycle Policy allows you to define how data is stored and accessed based on predefined criteria. You can 
	choose to keep certain data available for real-time access for periods where you know it'll be frequently 
	accessed and then archive it later when it won't be as in demand. You can also set rules for when and how 
	to delete expired data.
Q. Explain Object Lock feature in AWS S3?
A. Object lock allows for Write Once Read Many time(WORM) access to information. This prevents data from being 
	altered or deleted after it is created. It can be enabled and disabled upon creation of the bucket.
Q. What is Static Website Hosting in S3?
A. Static web hosting allows you to use a S3 bucket to host a static webpage. Static webpages cannot change 
	dynamically but may contain client-side scripts.
Q. What is a object URL?
A. A url somebody can use to access a hosted object. They are defaulted as private allowing only the owner 
	permission but the owner may grant permissions for others to download the contents.
Q. Explain Elastic Block Storage?
A. Elastic Block Storage(EBS) behave like raw unformatted block devices which you can mount as devices on 
	your instances. They persist independently from the instance they are mounted to and are best used for 
	data you need long term access to.
Q. What is the difference between terminating and stopping an EC2 instance?

A. AMI is a way to store AWS resource settings so that you can launch multiple identical instances without 
	having to manually configure them.
Q. What Is Public Key Credentials?
A.
