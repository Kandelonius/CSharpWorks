Questions to keep in mind -


1-What is .NET Framework?
    A- A developer platform made up of tools(Visual Studio, VSC, etc.), programming languages(C#, F#, Visual Basic),
    and libraries used for building different types of applications.
2-What is C#? 
    A- A type safe object oriented programming language built on the .NET Framework.
3-What is difference between value type and reference type? 
    A- A value type(int, bool, char) is stored on the stack and has a default value of 0 requires no
    garbage collection whereas a reference type(string, class, array) is stored in heap memory and
    does require garbage collection to clean up.
4-What is garbage collection?
    A- A process where unused memory is reallocated so it can be used for some other purpose. This memory is technically
    still in-tact until something else is assigned to it.
5-What is JIT Compiler? 
    A- "Just In Time" compiler converts code from human readable()
6-Difference between Implicit & explicit Conversion?
    A- Implicit is lower precision to higher precision and has no data loss. int can be implicitly converted to double
       Explicit is higher level to lower level precision and does have data loss. Explicit requires casting
7-Difference boxing & unboxing in C#?
    A- Boxing is converting a value type into an object type
       Unboxing is taking an object type and converting it to a value type, and it requires casting
8-What are operators in C#?
    A- operators allow us to do things such as compare things, perform calculations, build and initialize things etc. they
       include but are not limited to arithmatic, boolean, unary, and logical operators
9-What are && and || operators?
    A- These are logical operators:
        && is the and operator and is used when both conditions must be true
        || is the or operator and is used when only one condition needs to be true
10-What is difference between if else and switch case? 
    A- switch is overall much quicker than if else because it goes straight to the relevant condition whereas an if else
       statement will try every condition until it gets to the correct condition
11-Difference between while and do-while loop?
    A- A while loop will check the condition at the begining of the loop, so if the condition is already met when you enter the
       loop the code inside will never run. A do-while loop will always run at least once and check the condition at the end of
       each iteration
12-Difference between for and foreach loop? 
13-What is difference between break and continue keyword? 
    A- In a switch statement if a break is reached the switch will terminate but if a continue is reached the program will pass
       control to the next iteration and allow the method to keep running
14-What is array in C#?
15-Difference between single dimensional array and mutli-dimensional array?
    A- a single dimensional array is a collection of things, but is only a single row of values whereas a multi-dimensional array
       has rows and columns
16-What is access specifier?
17-What is default access specifier of a class?
18-Difference between protected and internal access specifier?
19-Difference between Static and non-static method in c#?
20-Difference between virtual and abstract method?
21-What is an extension method?
22-What is a partial method?
23-What is a sealed class?
24-What is a Constructor in C#?
25-Difference between static and non-static Constructor?
26-What is difference between default & parametrized constructor?
27-Difference between ref & out parameters in C#?
28-What is params parameters in C#?
29-Difference between abstract class and interface?
    A- Abstract classes can have implementations for some of its members whereas interface members cannot have
    any implementations
30-What is inheritance?
31-What is DBMS?
32-What is collection in C#?
33-What is difference between Stack and Queue?
34-Difference between ArrayList and List?
1-Is C# is case sensitive programing language?
    A- Yes, there is a distinct difference between a variable, method, class etc. that has capitals and one that doesn't even
       if they otherwise spell the same word
2-What is the use of var keyword?
4-What is access specifier in C-Sharp?
5-What is the default access specifier of class and class members?
6-Difference between .exe and .dll.
7-What is Unary operator?
8-What is namespace?
9-What is non-static or instance method?
10-Difference between static and non-static?

CLR - Common Language Runtime: runtime environment that manages the execution of programs written in
    any language that uses .NET Framework
MSIL - Microsoft Intermediate Language: a CPU-independent set of instructions that can be efficiently 
    converted to native code. A combination off dll and exe
.dll - Dynamic Link Library - does not contain a Main method: class library
.exe - Executable File - contains the Main method
JIT - Just In Time - compiler, it translates native C# code to machine code aka MSIL
Compile Time - the period of time when the developer's code is converted into machine code. Generates exe and dll
Run Time - the period of time where the code is executed. Gives final output
CTS - Common Type System - defines how types are declared, used and managed in the CLR and 
      important for cross-language integration
CLS - Common Language Specification - defines a set of features that are needed by many common
      applications, and provides guidelines for .NET languages

How to create an instance of a class
   ClassName objectName = new ClassName();
            
Var Keyword:
   1. Whenever you declare var you must assign a value to it
   2. Var cannot be assigned a Null value
   3. When var is assigned a value it will be stored as a specific data type
   4. When it is assigned as a data type it will behave like that data type
   5. You can use var as a local variable
   6. Can't declare var as a class level variable or parameterized variable
   7. Can't use var as a return type in a method declaration
              
Conversions:

   A. Converting lower precision values into higher precision values is called implicit conversion
   B. No type casting is required *Example: sbyte can be converted to short
   C. No data loss
              
2. Explicit Conversion -
   A. converting higher precision values to lower precision values is known as explicit conversion
   B. Must type cast
   C. Possibility of data loss
              
Boxing and Unboxing:
              
1. Boxing -
   A. Converting value type into an object type
   B. No type casting is required

---------------------------------------10th June 2021---------------------------------------
Access Specifier in CSharp
1-Public - It will be accessible in whole solution.
2-Private - Only allowed inside the class.
3-Protected - Derived class instance only can access protected members.
4-Internal - Type or member can be accessed by code in the same assembly, but not from another assembly.
5-Protected Internal - The type or member can be accessed only within its declaring assembly, by code 
    in the same class or in a type that is derived from that class. 

----------------------------------------------11th June 2021------------------------

Abstract Method in C-Sharp - The abstract keyword enables you to create classes and class members that are 
incomplete and must be implemented in a derived class
    1-If you would like to create an abstract method then the class must also be abstract.
    2-It does not mean that if you have defined an abstract class that you also have to define an abstract method.
    3-You can't define the body of an abstract method.
    4-You can't define an abstract method as a private method.
    5-Inside the abstract class you can also define non-abstract methods like non-static, static, virtual etc.
    6-If you have defined a static method under an abstract class that method can be accessed with the abstract
    class.
    7-Besides static methods you can't access any other method with abstract class because you can't create an
    instance of an abstract class.
    8-If you would like to use an abstract method then you will have to use inheritance which means you will
    inherit the abstract class and in the other class and then you will have to provide the body of all the 
    abstract methods in that inherited class. And when you provide the body you will have to use 'override' keyword.

-----------------------------------------14th June 2021---------------------------------------------------
Extension Method in C#
    1-When you will define a extension method then you will have to use static modifier.            
    2-Extension method parameter must be passed 'this' keyword with the type.
    3-Class must be static class.
    4-Only the type have the rights to access this method.

What is Constructor in CSharp?
    Ans:-Constructor is a special type of method. It does not contain return type,it has the same name
    as we have the class name. Every class has a default constructor. And default Constructor will be 
    called automatically whenever you will create the instance or object of the class. And the role of
    default constructor is to assign the default value to the class level fields.

    If you have normal class then it will get default constructor. If you have static class then it will
    get default static constructor and static constructor role is to assign the default value to static
    fields of the class. Only one static constructor you can define or by default it exists.

Constructor Types in C#
    1-Default Or Parameterless Constructor :- If you will not manually define the it will be called as
    a default constructor but when you will create the parameterized then default constructor will be 
    removed and if you would like to define default constructor then manually you will have to define it
    and it will be parameterless constructor.
    
    2-Parameterized Constructor or Overload Constructor
    
    3-Copy Constructor
    
    4-Static Constructor -
        A-If you will define static constructor you can't use access specifier.
        B-You can define only one static constructor.
        C-Static constructor must be parameterless constructor.
        D-Static constructor will be called before the Main method.
        E-Static constructor you can define under the static as well as non-static class.
        F-Static has not any relation with the instance or object.
        G-Static Constructor will assign the default value to the static fields of the class.
    
    5-Private Constructor

        --------------------------------------------15th June 2021----------------------------------------------
    Interface in CSharp
    1-Whenever you will create a interface just keep 'I' as prefix with the interface name. It does not
    mandatory but it is a part of naming convention which you should follow.
    2-You will use interface keyword to create the interface and interface will contain only property, method,
    delegate, events.
    3-You can only declare the members inside the interface. You can't provide the body.
    4-You can't use any access specifier with interface members because they are by default public.
    5-To access the members of interface, you will have to inherit interface with the class and that time
    you will have to provide the body of all the members of interface. 
    6-When you will provide the body of all the interface members that time you will have to use public
    as a access specifier otherwise it will be not treated as interface members.
    7-You can't create the instance of interface.
  

  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Array in CSharp
        1-Array is a reference type.
        2-Array is fixed in size.
        3-Array index will start with 0.
        4-Array max index will be 'size-1'.
        5-If is good if you would like to store same data types multiple value.
        6-It is type safe.

        Array Type in C#
            1-Single Dimensional Array 
            2-Multi Dimensional Array 
            3-Jagged Array 


            1-Single Dimensional Array 
            int[] myFirstNumbers = new int[] { 1, 2, 3, 43, 5 };

            2-Multi Dimensional Array 
            int[,] mySecondNumbers = new int[3, 2] { { 12, 22 }, { 223, 224}, { 422, 511 }};
            Console.WriteLine(mySecondNumbers[0,1]);
            
            for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++)rows
            {
                for (int j = 0; j < 2; j++)columns
                {
                    Console.Write(mySecondNumbers[i,j]+" ");
                }
                Console.WriteLine();
            }

            3-Jagged Array 

            int[][] myThirdNumbers = new int[2][];0 1
            myThirdNumbers[0]=new int[2] { 1, 2 };
            myThirdNumbers[1] = new int[] { 2,4,5 };

            Console.WriteLine(myThirdNumbers[1][1]);

            int[][,] myFourthNumbers = new int[2][,];0 1
            myFourthNumbers[0] = new int[3,2] { { 12, 22 }, { 223, 224 }, { 422, 511 } };
            myFourthNumbers[1] = new int[2,2] { { 12, 22 }, { 223, 224 }};

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Enum in C#
    1-It is value type and user define.
    2-To Declare the enum you will have to use 'enum' keyword.
    3-You can define it inside the namespace or inside the class.
    4-Enum default data type is int.
    5-Enum will start by default with 0 and it will add +1 for next item.
    6-Enum will not allow any other data type except all int types.

 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Class in CSharp
    1-It is reference type and user define type.
    2-It gets memory on heap.
    3-GC is required for clean up.
    4-You will have to use 'class' keyword to define class.
    5-It is good for large amount of data storage.
    6-All pre-define reference type derive from class.
    7-We can define parameter less constructor.    

    Struct In CSharp
    1-It is value type and user defined type.
    2-It gets memory on stack.
    3-GC not required.
    4-You will have to use 'struct' keyword to define structure.
    5-It is good for small amount of data storage.
    6-All pre-defined value types are derived from struct.
    7-You can't define explicitly a parameterless constructor but internally default constructor exists.
    8-Struct will also behave same like class with some limitation.
